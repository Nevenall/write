# Write

My template for markdown projects; just fork and write!

## Compiles to Html

Uses Gulp and UnifiedJS to compile markdown to html and execute other tasks such as spell checking and word counting.

## BookShelf Integration

The output of a write project integrates directly with [BookShelf](https://github.com/Nevenall/bookshelf) for presentation as an offline-first PWA.

## Internal Links

Includes custom tweaks to convert internal links to .md files to .html files upon compile.

## Visual Studio Code Integration

Includes vs code integration to execute Gulp tasks and a problem matcher for spell checking.
